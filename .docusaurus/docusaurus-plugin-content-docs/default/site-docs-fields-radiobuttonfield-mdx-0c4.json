  "description": "Radio buttons is the group of options that let user select only one value from group of values. These are clickable components which are used to select a single option from a set of options. These components are mostly used as an alternative to a dropdown and are commonly used when the number of options is limited and the options are clear. Depending on the form builder being used, this can be achieved by inserting radio buttons in a group, or it can be done without a group. The settings of the radio button is as similar as checkbox field.",
