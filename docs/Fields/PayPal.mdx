Admin can receive **One-time Payment** & **Subscription Payment** through the PayPal field. Bit Form now allows you to use **PayPal fields** instead of the **submit button**. So, when admins use PayPal, they can remove the default submit button from the form. When a user clicks on the PayPal button, the form first validates all the form input and then opens the payment window.

## Create PayPal Config 

 1. Navigate to the Bit Form dashboard. Then go to `App Settings` & click on `Payments`.
