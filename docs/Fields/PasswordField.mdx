 *  Name - only characters & space
 *  Username - only lowercase characters & numbers
 *  Character Limit - default is set to a maximum of 100 characters
 *  Word Limit - default is set to a maximum of 30 words

After selecting any predefined pattern, you can customize those too.

:::

For each pattern, the user can set `Flag` to control how the regex pattern will work for the text field.

**g( global)-** With this flag, the search looks for all matches, without it – only the first match is returned.

**i (case-insensitive)-** With this flag, the search is case-insensitive: no difference between A and a. 

**s(single line)-** Enables “dot all” mode, which allows a dot . to match newline character \n.

**m (multi line)**- Multiline mode.

**u (unicode)-** Enables full Unicode support.

**y (sticky)-** “Sticky” mode: searching at the exact position in the text.

### 9.Unique Entry Validation:
