**Double Opt-In:**

When users submit their email in your form responses, a double opt-in email is required to confirm their email. So when they subscribe to your newsletter, they need to click on an email with a confirmation link (button) to confirm the validity of their email address. Integration, Webhook and E-mail notifications will not work before confirmation. Go through this documentation on how to apply Double Opt-In in your form.

6.**Edit verification messages:** The user who received the double opt-in email after submitting the form. Needs to click on an email with a confirmation link (button) to confirm the validity of their email address. After clicking the confirmation button, you will show the success or error message. You can edit this message with this option. Also, you can Redirect the page confirmation or error.

 There are three types of verification messages under this option 
 1. Activation success (can be edited or redirected)

 3. Invalid activation key (can be edited or redirected)


### Configure default confirmation email template

<Image src="Double-Opt-In/double-optin-template" alt="Bit Form Double Opt-In" w="1875" h="350" />
<Image src="Double-Opt-In/double-optin-url" alt="Bit Form Double Opt-In" w="1875" h="350" />

By disabling this option, you can manually configure the double opt-in confirmation email from Conditional Logics. You can set the condition if you want to send a confirmation message with any condition. And customize the confirmation template as your own. Please read our doc about creating an [email template](https://docs.form.bitapps.pro/wpbitform-email-template). Make sure that this link(**{entry_confirmation_url}**) is included where (text, button, link) the user clicks for confirmation. Otherwise, Double Opt-In will not work.
The link is: {entry_confirmation_url}<br/>
The link is: **{entry_confirmation_url}**

Now, you have to set conditional logic to trigger the Double Opt-In. When you set conditional logic, remember some points <br/>
Action Run When: Record Create/Edit<br/>
Action Effect: On Form Load<br/>
Action Behaviour: Always
Also check the Double Opt-In from Action.
