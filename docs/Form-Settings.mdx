## Overview

The following features are available under ***Form Settings*** -

✔ Allow Single Entry for each IP address

✔ Disable this form after limited entry

✔ Honeypot

✔ Limit form submission period

✔ Blocked IP list

✔ Allowed IP
 
✔ SMTP Configuration

✔ Form import & export


### Allow Single Entry for each IP address
One form can be submitted one time from each IP address. Suppose you are submitting a form using/from this IP 123.123. 12.1. You can not submit the same form again from the same IP address but you can submit the form using another IP address which is not used yet to submit the same form.

### Disable this form after limited entry
If you want to disable the form after certain entries you can use this feature. Suppose you have decided that after 100 times submission you want to disable the form than this feature is for you

### Honeypot
It is a well-known fact that spambots are real trouble today. One of the common problems web developers face is that spambots create web forms to submit spam messages to the websites. Spam prevention is not easy because of intelligent bots. Though re-captcha will help you in this situation by setting some challenges or tricks to avoid bots, sometimes you can get into an endless trap which is annoying to some visitors. So, we have come with a better experience for spam protection while submitting web forms & that is an intelligent “Honeypot,” aka a hidden field.

The main goal of today’s article is – how you can prevent a bot from submitting the form using Honeypot in Bit Form. Our previous article demonstrated to you how you could add hidden fields manually using conditional logic. But now, you can use Honeypot by enabling a simple option from the settings. In this article, we will show you how you can do that.

**What is Honeypot & how does it work?**
 
Honeypot is a security technique that helps an administrator to prevent form submission by a spam bot. With Honeypot, an admin can prevent spamming, which decreases spamming compliance of your website.

Honeypot works by setting up an automatic trap that will catch the hackers when they try to submit a form with a script. It checks if the hidden field is filled up by someone who will be obviously a bot because a real human can not view the field.

**How does Honeypot work on Bit Form?**

✔ To set up “Honeypot” on Bit Form –

✔ Create a form or select a form you have created before.

✔ Navigate to “Form settings” from the “Settings” option.

✔ Enable the option “Honeypot trap for bot” & save the settings

<Image src="Honeypot-Bit-Form (2)" alt="New-Form" w="1000" h="350" />

This settings will automatically create some hidden fields that a real human can’t access, but bot will take it as a part of web forms. As it starts to try to fill those fields, it will end up revealings as “Spambots” Whenever bots try to fill those hidden fields & submit the form an error message will be displayed “Trying to submit the form by bot”.


### Limit form submission period
If you want to disable the form after certain entries you can use this feature. Suppose you have decided that after 100 times submission you want to disable the form than this feature is for you

<Image src="Bit-Form-limit-period" alt="New-Form" w="1000" h="450" />

### Blocked IP list
The blocked listed IP addresses can not submit your form. Suppose you have noticed that from specific IP addresses a form is being submitted as spamming and you do not like it. In this case, you can use this feature, you can list those IP here and form submission from those IP will not be accepted anymore.And you can also disable the blocked listed IPs whenever you want.
For example, you want to disallow submission from the below listed IPs
103.145.119.253
103.145.119.251
103.145.119.250
Just put these three IPs on blocked list and enable blocked option. Now, no more submission will be accepted from those IPs

<Image src="Bit-Form-block-ip" alt="New-Form" w="1000" h="450" />

### Allowed IP
In some cases, some organization or company want to accept form submission from some specific IP addresses. Only in those situations, this feature will be helpful for them.

By enabling this option only the listed IP can submit this form.

Suppose you have listed these two IP 123.123. 12.1 and 123.123. 12.2 Now, only form submission from these two IPs will be accepted.

### SMTP Configuration
A new addition to our Bit Form plugin is – SMTP configuration. A lot of site owners face the spam mail problem for using the WordPress default PHP mail function.SMTP is a protocol that helps your WordPress site to make its email deliverability more easygoing & reliable. By enabling this feature you can send mail from your site to your recipients via your preferred mail server.

**Watch the video here!**

**How does SMTP works :**
At first, you have to open an account on your desired hosting provider (e.g: MailGun, Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Zoho mail). By opening an account you are authenticating your WordPress site. They will provide you the necessary credentials (e.g.: Encryption type, SMTP port ). You have to put this information when configuring SMTP on your site. Once your site is authenticated you can send mail through your preferred SMTP server. All the email validation work will be done on your specified SMTP server.


You don’t have to use different SMTP plug-in or different workflow of SMTP providers. We bring it all in one feature. To access all the mail services you need professional mail addresses. The mail services you can use through this feature:

✔ MailGun SMTP [5,000 free email /per month for 3 months]

✔ Gmail SMTP [6,000 free email/per month]

✔ Hotmail

✔ Yahoo

✔ AWS SES

✔ ZOHO Mail

**Process of SMTP settings :** 

To configure you need to go WordPress Dashboard. Then click to Bit Form. From Bit Form to Settings. Then go to SMTP option.

➤ SMTP authentication: Set the authentication YES always.

➤ SMTP Username & Password: Enter your username & password that you use to login into your mail server.

After clicking the ‘Save Changes’ your SMTP configuration will be finished. Now you are ready for the test to see whether SMTP settings works or not!

**2.SMTP Testing :**

This testing option will help you to verify that actually, your website can relay outgoing mail to the referred recipients. SMTP testing option consists of :

➤ To Field: Type the email address to whom you want to send the mail.

➤ Subject Field: Include the subject of your message.

➤ Message Field: Write your message to this text field.

***Let’s see an example to clear this out!***

 ▪ Let say you open an account on a mail server using your Gmail (e.g.: xyz@gmail.com) to send all the emails from your site.

 ▪ Now you want to see what will recipients see when they get your mail. Then set an alternate Gmail(abc_14@gmail.com) in the ‘To’ field & set the subject, message.

 ▪ Clicking on  ‘Send Test’ your mail will relay to the Gmail SMTP server. Gmail will validate the information you have set before(username, password)

 ▪ When Gmail will validate your mail then the mail will be delivered to abc_14@gmail.com.Hence your mail will be delivered safely to your recipient via the SMTP server.
