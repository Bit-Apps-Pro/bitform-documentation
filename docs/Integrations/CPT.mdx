Sometimes, it is difficult for WordPress default post types to satisfy all the website owner’s requirements regarding the content management system. Here comes Custom post type(CPT) handy. CPT allows you to create ‘post_types’ beyond traditional WordPress ‘post_types'(Post, Page, Attachment, Revision, Navigation Menu, Custom, ChangeSets).  CPT makes your website truly a ‘Content Management System.’

Custom Field type is simply types of content that you can customize according to your website’s requirements. CPT is a new edition of our Bit Form integration section. Also, Bit Form users don’t have to install other CPT plugins as we are providing a built-in Custom Post Type option. You just have to create a custom post type & Bit Form will automatically create a post regarding that particular post type after successful form submission. It is one step easier for our users to manage their website content in a specific way they want.
