2. When you fill-up the audience list field, you will find the ***Map Field*** option. You have to map all the necessary form fields with the related Sendinblue field.

3. The addresses fields of Sendinblue are fixed – ***Email***, ***Last Name***, ***First Name*** & ***SMS***. These fields are required for the Sendinblue audience.

4. You can also update the submitted data by enabling the action called ***Update Sendinblue***. Suppose the user already submitted data under an email address. Again they want to submit data under the same email, if the action is enabled then the new data will be updated regarding that email address.

6. Now, you have to set conditional logic to trigger the integration for the submitted data. When you set conditional logic, remember some points – set ‘Action behavior = Always’ & specify the integration name you have created for Sendinblue . If you don’t select the integration name properly, then the integration will not work.
