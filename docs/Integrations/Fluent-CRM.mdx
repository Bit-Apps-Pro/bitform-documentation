Managing your leads from your website in an effective way is essential to growing your business. Fluent CRM is a powerful email marketing tool that can help you make your website visitors active leads. Bit Form integration with Bit Form allows you to capture leads from your website and automatically import them to your CRM, where you can nurture them until they become sales-ready.

## Integration Settings:
1. Before setting up the integration, you must confirm that the Fluent CRM plugin is activated on your site. Otherwise, the integration will not work.

 ***Settings => Integrations =>  Click on (+) => Click on ‘Fluent CRM’.***

5. Select the Fluent CRM list on the “Fluent CRM” field that you have created before on your CRM account. All your subscribers will be listed under this list.

6. You can select multiple tags for the list on the ‘Fluent CRM Tags‘ field. You have to create them earlier on the CRM. Tags will help you to search the list & leads easily.

7. Then, you have to map the form fields with Fluent CRM fields. By default, the field is “Email“.  You can select multiple fields from map field settings.
