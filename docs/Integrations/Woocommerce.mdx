3. You can only create **Simple Product** & **Affiliate Product** through Bit Form. When you map all the form fields, you have to remember some default values on WooCommerce fields. So you have to mention those values on the back end of the form builder. Which are:

   - Product status - pending, draft, publish, future, private & trash.

   - Product type - simple, external

   - Allow Backorder - no, notify, yes

   - Allow Reviews - open, closed

   - Virtual - yes, no

   - Manage Stock - yes, no

   - Sold Individually - yes, no

   - Downloadable - yes, no

 :::info

 The values are case-sensitive, so make sure to give it the same value as all small letters.

4. You can customize the product **categories** & **tags** according to your choice from Bit Form. Also, you can use the default options here. All the categories will be **parent type**. 

 :::tip

 If any of the category or tags already exist in your WoocCommerce, then it will be referenced to that particular category/tag, otherwise it will create a new one.

5. If you select the downloadable product, then you have to add attachment file fields. For this, you have to map the form field from the `Map file upload fields` section which is **Downloadable Files**.
