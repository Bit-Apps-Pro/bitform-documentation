**Update Rows by criteria:** 

First, you have to map the fields you want to update the value. Here is an example, we have mapped the ‘Name’ fields, as we want to update that corresponding field’s value. Now, click on the action ‘Update Record’. It controls how the submitted records will get updated. Now you have to set the criteria by specifying the Zoho field link. Depending on this field link, your mapped field’s value will change.

Here, we have set the field link “Email = test@bitcode.pro”. So, all the names corresponding to the email will be updated. If you face any difficulties, visit the ‘Zoho Creator Guide‘.

If we enable the update preference ‘Yes‘, then after submission of data, it will check the criteria. If the criteria match then it will update otherwise the values will be added as a new record. 

After setting up the integration process , set conditional logic as before.

**Upload File:**

For uploading files, you have to map the fields with the necessary Zoho fields. Select ‘File Upload‘ as both Bit Form & Zoho fields. Now, you are ready to upload a file on the Creator account.
