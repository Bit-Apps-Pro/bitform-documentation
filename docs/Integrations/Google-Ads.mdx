## How will this integration work?
Here we will demonstrate a simple example of how this integration will help Bit Form users to gather information regarding advertisements.

⇛ If a visitor search for a keyword that is relatable to the keywords you have set for your ads, then Google Ads will display the ad.

⇛ When visitors click on the ads, the ads will drive the visitor to the landing page of your website. In this process, GCLID will be created regarding that visitor. If the visitor fills up the form attached with that page, then all the information of lead and that GCLID will be stored on the Bit Form responses. This GCLID is a link between Google AD & Bit Form.
