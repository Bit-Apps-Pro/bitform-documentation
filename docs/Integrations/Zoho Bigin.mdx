Now click ‘Authorize‘ & you are ready to add all records to your ZOHO Bigin account.

## Add Records in module:
### Mapping Settings:

2. Map fields: You have to map the Bit Form fields with Zoho Bigin fields to push the records. As an example, here we have set ‘Text Field1’ = ‘Last Name.’ So when the user fills up ‘Text Field1’, the value will be stored in the corresponding Zoho field  ‘Last Name.’ You can map multiple fields as you need. Also, can send custom value to Zoho Bigin.

### Add Profile photo:
