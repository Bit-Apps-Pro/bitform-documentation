Zapier is a web-based automation tool that allows you to connect different web applications and services. Bit Form allows you to create online forms for your website and receive real-time webhooks on successful form submission. With Zapier you can trigger a Zap from the submission of a form on your website, and once you do that, you can choose which of your connected applications or services you want to get notified about.

## Integration Settings:
1. At first, select any existing form or create any form to use the Zapier webhook integration.
