***5. Upsert Record:*** Upon selecting the option YES, if a record with the identical value exists in Zoho CRM, it will be updated with the new values. If you select NO, a new record will be created in Zoho CRM. You can arrange fields in the order in which upsert should happen.

Here’s how upsert works:

For example, you arrange the Email field before the Company field. When a form is submitted with the Company as Bitcode and Email as bitcode@gmail.com.

1. First, it’s checked if the email bitcode@gmail.com exists in the CRM. If it does, then the mapped fields get updated to the record associated with that email address.

2. In case of the email address bitcode@gmail.com doesn’t exist in your CRM,  it’s checked if Bitcode exists under Company. If it does, then the mapped fields get updated to the record associated with that company name.

3. If none of the field values exists, then a new record with all the mapped details is created under the mapped CRM module
