Using OneDrive integration with WordPress form builder, you can send attachments to your OneDrive. You can easily integrate without any coding. This Documentation goes through the configuration process.

## Authorization Process

1. At first, select the form you want to apply the OneDrive integration. If you don’t have any then create a new one from ‘Create Form’. After that, follow the below instructions.

 Follow the path:
 ***Settings => Integrations => Click on (+) => Click on ‘OneDrive’.***

 <Image src="onedrive/select-one-drive" alt="OneDrive" w="1020" h="350" />



2.	**Integration Name:** Set the proper integration name. Default it's taken ‘OneDrive’.

3. After that, To get the **Client Id & Client Secret**, click on `Azure Portal`. <br/> For client ID & secret you have to visit the **Azure Portal**. If you already have any Client ID & secret before then copy this to the field. If you don’t have any then you have to create a new client ID & secret, Register an App by clicking `New Registration`
    1. **Name:** In the name field, put the proper app name of your choice.
    2. **Supported account types:** Personal Microsoft accounts only
    3. **Redirect URI:** Select Web as a platform from the drop-down list. Copy the Redirect URIs from integrations settings and paste it under Redirect URI field. And click on the Register button.

4. Now an app will create with a Client ID. Navigate to `Certificates & secrets` and create a client secret to get the client secret. Then copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret (Value)` and paste them to the Bit Integrations integration page. Then click on the `Authorize` button (wait for a few seconds). After the successful authorization, click on the `Next` button

 <Image src="onedrive/client-secret" alt="OneDrive" w="1020" h="350" />

5.	After completing the authorization process, select the specific folder from the dropdown menu, which you have created before on OneDrive.

## Actions
1.	**Upload Files:** Upload Files is a mandatory action. To send an attachment to the OneDrive, you must select the required file upload field from actions.

2.	**Delete File From WordPress:**  By enabling this option,  the file is automatically deleted from WordPress after uploading to OneDrive.

4. After completing the settings, you have to set the conditions when this integration works. Don’t forget to specify the integration name; otherwise, the integration will not work correctly. Here we have set the condition that – every time when records will be created/ edited, on form submission the integration will be triggered.

5. Now, whenever a user submits the form with the file upload field, it will be added to the file/files of One Drive. Also can view from form responses of Bit Form.
