Another integration that eases your email marketing is **MailPoet integration** via Bit form. When users submit any form, the email of that corresponding user will store in the newsletter list of MailPoet. For more details go through this documentation carefully.

## Authorization Process
1. At first, select the form you want to apply the MailPoet integration. If you don’t have any then create a new one from ‘Create Form’.  After that, follow the below instructions. Follow the path:

  ***Settings => Integrations =>  Click on (+) => Click on ‘MailPoet’***.

2. Before setting up the integration, you must confirm that the ***MailPoet plugin*** is activated on your site. Otherwise, the integration will not work.

3. Now, click on the ***Authorize*** button to complete authorization settings.

2. Then you have to map the form fields with MailPoet fields. By default, the field is ***Email***. Also, you set any field required on MailPoet it will be automatically displayed on your map settings. You can set multiple fields from map field settings.

4. After completing the settings, you have to set the conditions when this integration works. Don’t forget to specify the integration name; otherwise, the integration will not work correctly. Here we have set the condition that – every time when records will be created/ edited, on form submission the integration will be triggered.
