## Integration Settings
1. After successful authorization. Select the Action(`Add/Update Subscriber`, `Delete Subscriber`) from the drop-down option. Also select the List from the drop-down option. You have to create a list before on your Acumbamail account. 

  **A. Add/Update Subscriber:** If you select this option from the drop-down, a new customer will be added to your Acumbamail list, or the user already exists in your list; It will then update the customer based on the email address.

  **B. Delete Subscriber:** If you selected this option from the drop-down, the records would be deleted from your Acumbamail account based on the email address.

4. After completing the settings, you have to set the conditions when this integration works. Don’t forget to specify the integration name; otherwise, the integration will not work correctly. Here we have set the condition that – every time when records will be created/ edited, on form submission the integration will be triggered.
