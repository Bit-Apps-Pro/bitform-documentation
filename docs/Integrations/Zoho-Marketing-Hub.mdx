2. You have to map the Bit Form fields with Zoho Marketing Hub fields to enlist the leads. As an example, here we have set **Name = First Name**. So when the user fills up **Name**, the value will be stored in the corresponding Zoho field  **First  Name**. You can map multiple fields as you need. Also, can send custom value to Zoho Bigin.
