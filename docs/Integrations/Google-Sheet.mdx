In a new addition to our integration section, recently, we have added a new integration with **Google Sheet**. From now on, you can store all the submitted data to google sheet by Bit Form.

## Authorization Settings:

At first, select the name of the form you want to apply the Google Sheet integration; after that, follow the below instructions.

Follow the path:

***Settings=> Integrations => Click on (+) => Click on ‘Google Sheet’***

A. Integration Name: Set the integration name ***Google Sheet API***.

B. Homepage URL: Enter the URL of your website.

C. Authorized Redirect URL: Enter the URL in which Google Sheet will send the authentication code.

D. Client ID & Secret: For client ID & secret you have to visit the ***Google API console***. If you already have any Client ID & secret before then copy this to the field. If you don’t have any then you have to create a new client ID & secret.

If you don’t have any then you have to create a new client ID & secret.

To get new Client Id & Client secret information go to Google ***API CONSOL=> Credentials=>Create Credentials=> OAuth Client ID => Select Application Type=> Give a Client Name => Add home page URL => Add authorized URL***.

Register all the information and get your client ID & Secret information from google sheet.

Now give ID & Secret to the fields & click ***Authorize*** & you are ready to import all your data from Bit Form to your Google Sheet.
