## Success or Error Message

*** Success Message ***

After form submission one can see the success message ***Your form has been submitted successfully***. For example: ***The form has been successfully submitted*** or ***We will contact you in 24 hours*** etc.

Success message works on both form submission and field validation. Based on the condition you can show custom success messages.
