An **API (Application Protocol Interface)** defines a set of functions that interact with other software components or applications or you can call micro services between web applications. If any web application or software needs any information from another software, they have to make a **call** or **request** to get the information. This specific call or request is called **API**.

To simplify this context, we can take an example that a user installed a form plugin from which he/she wants to deliver form data to our Bit Form plugin where user has already made a form. What user has to do is to make an API request to Bit Form. In response, user will get all the data that they have requested will be stored in Bit Form.

## API key Option

1. Go to Bit form **Settings** and then select **API**

2. Copy your API key then use it in request header.

## API Status Codes

The success or failure of an API request is conveyed by the code and message in its response.

**Requested Method is:***

GET

In this API request user have to indicate the specific id to ***form_id*** in which fields will be used to fetch information. Suppose a client sent an API request, under a specific form some field’s information will be inserted where , ***typ = field type***, ***lbl = field label name***, ***ph = a indicator of the fields action***. The ***valid : {}*** denotes ***True/False***. If the required field is enabled then ***valid : {}*** will return ***True*** otherwise ***valid : {}*** will be empty. Then ***fieldkeys***is the key name  of the input field. Clients can also run workflows using conditional logic by sending API requests. As example, if a client wants any records to be created & submitted, an email notification will be sent. Clients have to set this workflow & have to mention that specific workflow name on their API request. They can set actions like : ***Success Message***, ***Redirect URL***, ***Web hook***, ***Integration*** and run those actions through our API request. The ***workflow_key_name*** is the input key name of all the created workflows.
