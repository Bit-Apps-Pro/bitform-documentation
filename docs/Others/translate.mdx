Many of you have wanted to translate the Bit Form into your **native language**. So, in this tutorial, we are going to tell you how to transform your Bit Form into a **multilingual form** builder. We didn't translate our Bit Form into other languages, but we have made this plugin ready for translating by anyone on the internet. Before that, you should know a few things here:

1. **Become a WordPress.org user:** To translate Bit Form, you first need a WordPress.org user account because we will translate Bit Form via the [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/) website.<br/>**To login into WordPress, go to:** [login.wordpress.org/](https://login.wordpress.org/)

2. **Translated at least 90% of the stable release string:** To see all the translated strings into your Bit Form for a language, 90% of all strings must be translated before WordPress makes a language file for that particular language.
